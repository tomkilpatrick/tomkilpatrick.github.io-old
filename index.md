Research scientist in atmoshere-ocean interactions and climate variability.

Scripps Institution of Oceanography, UC San Diego.


## About

My research aims to better understand regional-scale interactions between components of the earth system, which strongly influence the climate variability that is "felt" by communities and nations, including the response to climate change.

Specific problems I have worked on recently:
- orographic wind forcing of coastal ocean circulation
- coupling between the surface wind field and rainfall
- SST - wind coupling in western boundary current regions

The approach I have developed is to combine observational (satellite and in situ) data analyses with computer simulations. This is a powerful method for developing robust explanations of earth system processes. I have also utilized modern data science methods (deep learning) for atmosphere–ocean interaction problems and satellite data algorithm development.

In addition to my appointment at Scripps, I am an affiliate scientist at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), where I work with the radar science group.
